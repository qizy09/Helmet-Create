## Helmet-Create
------------------------
# ECE150 Assignment 4
In this project, we create an Android app with which the stormtroopers can customize their helmets to have the color or pattern of their liking. The helmet model is **given by the dark lord himself** , and consists of two parts: the helmet base and the details. We use the LibGDX library for both 2D and 3D graphics. 

In this app, based on the template provided by TAs, I implemented:

 * Show the 3D model (or hologram) of a standard black-and-white stormtrooper helmet
 * Present a button with the logo of the First Order on the bottom left corner, and tapping the button will change the color of the helmetâ€™s details
 * Touch and drag the helmet with your finger should rotate the helmet
 * Implement pinch-in and pinch-out zooming of the helmet using gesture detector
 * The helmet also changes the TEXTURE, not only the color, iteratively between camouflage and aloha.
 * add background music to play for full Empire Strikes Back experience. When button is clicked odd times, the music pauses, when even time, the music continues.
