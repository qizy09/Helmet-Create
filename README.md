Assignment 4

In this app, based on the template provided by TAs, I implemented:

 * Show the 3D model (or hologram) of a standard black-and-white stormtrooper helmet
 * Present a button with the logo of the First Order on the bottom left corner, and tapping the button will change the color of the helmetâ€™s details
 * Touch and drag the helmet with your finger should rotate the helmet
 * Implement pinch-in and pinch-out zooming of the helmet using gesture detector
 * The helmet also changes the TEXTURE, not only the color, iteratively between camouflage and aloha.
 * add background music to play for full Empire Strikes Back experience. When button is clicked odd times, the music pauses, when even time, the music continues.
